# NV.Templates.Backend

{Project description}

## Next Steps

After generating the project using the template, here are the next steps to get started:
//#if (!nodoc)
- Think about the project architecture and start completing the [System Architecture Documentation](Documentation/System_Architecture.md) and [System Architecture Diagrams](Documentation/System_Architecture.drawio) (using [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)). Some architecture documentation sections are already pre-filled with important information regarding the template structure
//#endif

- Identify the project's Functional areas (e.g. Inventory, Payment, Product Catalog, Events, etc.)

- Review the referenced NuGet packages and apply the relevant updates *if needed*.
